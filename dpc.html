				<h4>My Role</h4>
				<p>I was the part of the amazing team responsible for the experience strategy and design of the webapp. I lead the UX work, producing all major deliverables and presenting them to the client. I worked alongside the Producer to define the scheduling cycle, as well as, the visual designers and engineers to begin producing a working prototype that will launch in the Fall of 2015.</p>
				<p><small><strong>The Team:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/NoraMKE">Nora Lahl</a>, <a href="http://mlatzke.com">Matt Latzke</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/foilking">Kevin Curtis</a>, <a href="davidmarten.com">David Marten</a></small></p>

				<h4>The Challenge</h4>
				<p>Our client approached us with two primary objectives — first, to design a system currently being managed manually by email and an outdated database model; Second, to make year-to-year scheduling and student contact easy and, at the risk of sounding crazy, even fun.</p>

				<h4>The Approach</h4>
				<h3>The Composite Planning Cycle</h3>
				<p>The first step was to work with the stakeholders mapping out their current yearlong process. Below you can see the scheduling flow deliverable I created from our many calls, emails, and brainstorming sessions. This document became the baseline for the project.</p>

				<h4>The Research</h4>
				<p>After defining the current process and getting the team on the same page, we created three different persona archetypes to facilitate discussons about needs, desires and contexts of use. We segmented the audience and categorized their behavioral activities such as <em>frequency of use</em>, skills such as <em>confidence with new systems</em>, and motivations such as <em>reasons for use</em>.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p class="quote">“Personas were used throughout the process to guide design decisions, facilitate discussions, and to help team members empathize with their users.”</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>We then used the persona hypothesis to focus discuss with two internal users/employees, three former student Picture Chairs, and lead three focus groups with departments and student groups. These conversations would help our team define the user stories and to prioritize our goals.</p>

				<p class="read-time"><small><strong>Note:</strong> This was our first time using the Focus Group method. As compared to results gained from one-on-one interviews, we found Focus Groups to not be as effective and even cost-prohibitive.</small></p>

				<h4>Sketching &amp; Brainstorming</h4>
				<p>After the goals and users had been defined, we began to sketch and brainstorm with the client. The sketches you'll see below were based off a set of user stories the team created with the client in an earlier workshopping exercise.</p>
				<p>We used <a href="http://invisionapp.com">Invision</a> to work through "paper" prototypes and to work collaboratively from Milwaukee, Chicago, and Austin to begin defining the Administrative Dashboard, user flow, and interactions.</p>

				<h4>Wireframing &amp; Copywriting</h4>
				<p>After testing the simple sketches with a few internal users and students, we began fleshing out the system with higher fidelity wireframes that contained more realistic content, so we could gauge users reactions.</p>
				<p>Not surpisingly, the students in DPC's audience would be handling much of the communication on their phones. We focused much of the design and copy for those touchpoints extremely carefully, so users could handle most tasks on their phones quickly.</p>
